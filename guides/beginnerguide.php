        <h2 class="card-title">Very Basic Flipping Guide</h2>
        <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Flipping in RuneScape is the practice of buying and reselling items with the goal of making a profit.</h6>
        <p class="card-text">Flipping is a type of short-term trading strategy where an investor buys an asset (such as a stock or item in a game)
        and sells it quickly at a higher price in order to make a profit.
        In the context of Runescape, flipping refers to buying and selling items in the game's Grand Exchange in order to make a profit.</p>
        <!------------ Next Paragraph ----------->
        <p class="card-text">To find an item's margin in Runescape, you need to look at the difference between the buy price and the sell price in the Grand Exchange.
        For example, if you see an item with a buy price of 100 coins and a sell price of 200 coins, the margin would be 100 coins (the difference between the two prices).</p>

        <p class="card-text">To determine which items are good to flip in Runescape, you want to look for items that have a high margin (a significant difference between the buy and sell prices),
        are in high demand, and have a stable price history. Some examples of items that are commonly
         flipped in Runescape include high-level weapons and armor, rare items, and popular resources like herbs and ores.
         However, it's important to do your own research and keep an eye on market trends to identify profitable opportunities.</p>
         <!------ Next Paragraph ----------->
         <h3 class="card-title">To find an items margin, follow these steps:</h3>
         <p class="card-text"><ul>
        <li>Go to the Grand Exchange in-game or use a third-party website(Like this one) that tracks the Grand Exchange or player given transactions.</li>
        <li>Look up the item you are interested in flipping by typing its name into the search bar.</li>
        <li>The results page will show you the current buy and sell prices of the item. The buy price is the price that players are offering to buy the item,
          and the sell price is the price that players are offering to sell the item.</li>
        <li>To find the margin, subtract the buy price from the sell price. For example,
           if the buy price is 100 coins and the sell price is 200 coins, the margin would be 100 coins (200 - 100 = 100).
          </li>

        It's important to note that the margins of items in the Grand Exchange can change quickly due to supply and demand, so it's important to monitor the market regularly if you plan on flipping items for profit.</br>
         Additionally, some items may have buy limits, which restrict the number of items that a player can purchase within a certain amount of time.
          Be aware of these limits when planning your flipping strategy.
          <hr>
          <p>Keep in mind Runescape 3 has a 2% tax and Oldschool Runescape has a 1% tax on all items</p>
        </ul></p>
